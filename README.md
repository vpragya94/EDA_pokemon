# EDA_pokemon

In this data analysis project, we utilized the Pokemon dataset, comprising information on over 1000 data available on the platform. With a dataset size of 37kb sourced from Kaggle, the main objective was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into customer preferences and demands. By leveraging EDA concepts, the project aimed to deliver actionable insights to developers, enabling them to popularize their apps by better understanding customer needs and preferences.

Roles & Responsibilities:
Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation for improved data quality and usability.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset.
Utilize statistical and data visualization techniques to present insights effectively.
Develop and implement data analysis methodologies, algorithms, and models.
Generate reports, dashboards, and visualizations to communicate data insights efficiently.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations to support data-driven decision-making.
Stay updated with industry trends and best practices in data analysis and technology.
